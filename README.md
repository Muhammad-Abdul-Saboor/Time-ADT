# Time-ADT
This project implements a Time Abstract Data Type (ADT) that allows users to easily manage and manipulate time. It supports setting and retrieving time values, incrementing hours, minutes, or seconds, and displaying the time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. It's useful for applications requiring basic time operations.
